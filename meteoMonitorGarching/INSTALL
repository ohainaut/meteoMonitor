meteoMonitor

This is an attempt to civilize the good old meteoMonitor package.


Unpack:

place the meteoMonitor directory into the destination directory,
i.e. currently /home/web/lasilla/docs/lasilla/dimm
(I know, THIS is not really clean. It works, OK?).


On 2001-10-17, the files are configured properly, so
  make all 
in meteMonitor directory should reinstall everything.


config:

- edit config.sm (that will become SuperMongo's  ~/.sm)
  update the paths if necessary

- edit meteo.config
  update the URLs if necessary. These are used in the automatically
  generated web pages for reload etc.

- edit meteorun
  update the paths

- make all


src:

- edit the makefile to update paths and configurations

- make all install
