<H1> Humidity Restrictions </H1>

<P> <B> Why:  </B> Domes should be closed whenever there appears to be a
significant risk of condensation at the level of the dome slit or the
telescope.  This is to avoid condensation dripping onto the mirror or
other equipment.  </P>

<P> <B> Restrictions: </B> When the humidity <font color=red>exceeds
90%</font> all telescopes should <font color=red>close
immediately</font>.  The telescopes can be reopened only after the
humidity has dropped below 85% for more than 30 consecutive minutes.
This should be done by opening the dome, and then checking that the
mirror cover is dry before opening it.  In case of a dispute, the
telescope should be closed, or remain closed, and then the astronomer
should refer to the La Silla Coordinator who has the final word.  </P>

<H1> Atmospheric Pressure </H1>

<P> The pressure is measured at the Vaisala meteo station (the 30m tower
near the 1m telescope) using a Rosemount sensor.  The scale on the
meteomonitor graph is given in hecto-Pascals (which are equivalent to
the more familiar millibar).  The pressure has been proven to be more
reliable than any other source of information for forecasting local
weather conditions, though occaisonally it produces false alarms!  The
lines which appear on the meteomonitor plot indicate the weather
associated with the measured pressure. </P>

<H1> Temperature </H1>

<P> The temperature is measured at the Vaisala meteo station (the 30m
tower near the 1m telescope) using senosrs at 2 meters (sensor 1),
underground (sensor 2) and at 30 meters (sensor 3).  The reading which
appears in the meteomonitor is the average reading from the two
above-ground sensors. </P>

<P> For astronomical observations, it is desirable to have a small
diurnal change in temperature.  Large changes in temperature lead to
convection currents and consequently poor mirror and dome seeing.  </P>

<A NAME="W_Help">
<H1> Wind Speed </H1>

<P> The wind speed is measured at the Vaisala meteo station (the 30m
tower near the 1m telescope) at 3 levels (10, 20, and 30 meters for
sensors 1, 2 and 3).  The wind sensors (both speed and direction) use
ball bearing mountings and optical encoders.  Wind data from levels 2
and 3 should agree quite well and produce the best data for the mountain
(the value given by the meteomonitor is an average of these two values).
</P>

<P> The sensor at the 3.6-m usually gives higher readings than the
meteomonitor.  However, this sensor does not give a true reading as it
is mounted on the top of the 3.6 dome, where a strong venturi forms.
</P>

<P> The highest wind speed this winter (1997) was about 39 m/s average
over one minute, and gusts in the 44 m/s range.  The highest gusts ever
recorded at La Silla slightly exceeded the measurement range of the
sensors (50 m/s).  </P>

<P> The most common wind direction is from the north-northeast.  If the
local wind direction is rotated 90 degrees anti-clockwise, the wind
direction at high altitudes is obtained.  This allows a prediction to be
made as to whether a cloud system visible on the satellite pictures will
pass over La Silla.  </P>

<P> Popular opinion has it that southern wind brings good weather,
though there is no strong evidence to support this idea.  Usually a wind
direction shift to the south occurs after some days of bad weather,
which means that the system is now on its way to the Atlantic Ocean, and
that we are in the backside of the air circulation.  </P>

<A NAME="S_Help">
<H1> Seeing </H1>

<P> The seeing is measured using a differential motion monitor (DIMM)
which is located close to the Schmidt telescope.  The DIMM calculates
the seeing using an analysis of the differential tilt of a wavefront at
two locations 20cm apart.  The standard deviation of the differential
slope of 200 exposures is converted into the FWHM of a long stellar
exposure. </P>

<A NAME="H_Help">
<H1> Humidity and Dew Point </H1>

<P> The humidity is measured at the Vaisala meteo station (the 30m tower
near the 1m telescope) using a thin-film polymer humicap at an altitude
of 2 meters.  The dew point is computed from the humidity and the
temperature measured at the same altitide as the humidity.
</P>

<P> If a telescope is fitted with temperature sensors, the best
protection against condensation can be obtained if the lowest
temperature at or near the telescope is compared to the dew point.  When
the two meet, water will form, and it's too late!  So the telescopes
should be closed <STRONG> before </STRONG> the dew point gets
close to the lowest telescope temperature.  </P>

<P> If there are no local thermometers, the relative humidity can be
used to judge whether condensation will form, but this is always
something of a gamble.  When there is some wind to equalize
temperatures, the 90% rule may be appropriate, but in calm conditions it
is very easy (you just need a surface cooled 1.5 degrees below ambient)
to get condensation at 90% humidity!  In calm conditions, a surface with
even only moderate ability to radiate, can easily cool down 3 or 4
degrees below ambient, when it looks into the cold sky.  At 4 degrees
difference, you will get condensation at 70% relative humidity!  So, it
is not possible to set strict operational limits of relative humidity
without knowing the radiation cooling of each area to be protected.
</P>

<P> A incoming warm air mass can also send the dew point up and over the
temperature of big structures having a long thermal inertia.  So,
increasing air temperature can be a sign that condensation may form.
</P>

<P> Finally, if your telescope is air-conditioned to 8 degrees during
the day, and then you open the dome into 12 degree warm air, 70%
relative humidity will soak your telescope without any need for
radiative cooling!  </P>

<P> The average relative humidity at La Silla is about 25%, though this
varies a lot between one year and the next.  </P>

<h1> Is the MeteoMonitor working</h1>

Some diagnostics: 

<p><dd> - Check the UT: if it is more than a few minutes old, the program
may be stopped. In that case it needs to be restarted (call the <a
href="#Contact_Help">DIMM Coordinator</a>).

<p><dd> - Check the last point of the graph. If it is old, the program
may be stopped. In that case it needs to be restarted (call the <a
href="#Contact_Help">DIMM Coordinator</a>).

<dd> - Check the Message area at the bottom of the page. There might
be some info on the status.

<h1>Who to contact in case of problem/suggestion</h1>

<dd> Support: the NTT operators are in charge of the operation of the
DIMM and MeteoMonitor. You can call them at the NTT: 4162. You can
also send a <a href="mailto:jmiranda@eso.org">mail</a> to Jorge
Miranda, the  DIMM coodinator.
