MeteoMonitor is run on   dimm@meli
Log on that account for all the actions described below
----------------------------------------------------------------------


0. INSTALLATION / RE-INSTALLATION

refer to INSTALL (Installation and Maintenance manual) in this directory



1. TO RUN THE PROGRAM

cd ~/dimm                      ! move to the  right directory
meteorun >& /dev/null &        ! start (GLC 15-03-2009)

(you have to put the /dev/null & to discard the output messages so that the
program continues running when you log out)



2. TO CHECK THAT THE PROGRAM IS RUNNING

ps -ef | grep meteo

you should get  something like 

    dimm  2246     1  0  Apr 25  ?         2:18 meteorun meteorun
    dimm 25635 23871  1 02:01:10 ttyp4     0:00 grep meteo

If you get only the grep meteo line, the program is not running and needs to 
be restarted



3. TO SET-UP A MeteoMonitor MESSAGE

Edit the file  dimm/meteo_msg.txt . It contains the HTML code of what is 
being printed at the bottom of the screen. Tratidionally, I start it with

<hr><b><font color=red>Message:</font></b>

to get a red, bold "Message"

To get something to blink, put is between  <blink> TEXT </blink>
To get something red, put it between       <font color-red> TEXT </font>
To get something in bold letters,          <b>    TEXT  </b>
